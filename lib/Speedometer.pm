=head1 SYNOPSIS

Speedometer : An easy interface to the Benchmark module. one can compare the performance of two Perl files.like this,
use Speedometer;

speedometer("file1","file2"); #by default it will run for 3 CPU seconds.

or one can give third optional argument i.e(time for which the code needs to perform i.e -10 or number of iterations i.e 100000).

speedometer("file1","file2",-10)
